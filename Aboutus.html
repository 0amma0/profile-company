            <p>At Cokobell, our mission is to spread happiness through sweet moments.
To make people happy, we have several programs:</p>
            <li>Free Cake for Everyone in Need – anyone who doesn’t have money can still enjoy our cakes, because joy should not depend on wealth.</li>
            <li>Green Packaging – we use eco-friendly packaging to reduce waste and take care of the environment.</li>
            <li>Celebration for All – on special days, we hold community events where everyone can gather, enjoy cakes, and share happiness together.</li>
